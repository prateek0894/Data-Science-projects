This is my attempt of Analytics Vidhya's hackathon problem on HR Analytics


They have provided multiple attributes around Employee's past and current performance along with demographics. Now, The task is to predict whether a potential promotee at checkpoint in the test set will be promoted or not after the evaluation process.


In this project I have built a model that predict employee is eligible for promotion or not.

I have make use of 4 models i.e Logistic regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification and Artificial Neural Network.

I verified the accuracy by calculating F1 score of the predicted value.

After checking the F1 score, I found out that ANN gave the best result with F1 Score of 0.498322147651007.

f1 score on logistic regression= 0.4026079869600652
f1 score on Decision Tree Classification= 0.45588235294117657
f1 score on Random Forest Classification= 0.4727564102564102
