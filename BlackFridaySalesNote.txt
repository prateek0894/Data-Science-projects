This is my attempt of Analytics Vidhya's hackathon problem on Predicting Black Friday Sales


A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

In this project I have built a model that predict the purchas amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

I have make use of two models i.e Decision Tree regression and Random Forest Regression.

I verified the accuracy by calculating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

After checking the rmse value, I found out that Random forest regression gave the better result with rmse value of 2934.07267386323.
